## Reviewer 1

 - [ ] reiterate the difference between additive and multiplicative noise - search for observation and dynamical noise - Helmut
 - [ ] more rigorous performance estimations - Simon
 - [ ] Further discussion on power spectrum changes, differences with simply fitting the power spectrum directly - Helmut
 - [ ] clarification of the underestimation of uncertainty, relate to advi - Simon
 - [ ] can the ratios be related to signal to noise ratios - Helmut


## Reviewer 2

- [ ] Explain criteria and metric for the term noise separability, figure 5 was mentioned in particular as the reviewer having trouble understanding what is meant by the noise being separable. - 
- [ ] From the perspective of noise removal, successful parameter
      estimation alone dose not mean that noise and signal are successfully
      separated. This is because if the added noise is large, it becomes
      difficult to estimate the original signal.
- [ ] Question, When using the  
      proposed parameter estimation method, can we estimate the original  
      signal of the OU process correctly?
